# 🔥 Gas Monitoring System using MQ2 Sensor and Arduino

This project demonstrates a simple **gas detection system** using the **MQ2 gas sensor** with an **Arduino Uno** and a **20x4 LCD display**. The system monitors gas concentrations (such as LPG, methane, smoke) and displays real-time data on the LCD. It also includes a **Proteus simulation** for virtual testing.
